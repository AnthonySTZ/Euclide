SAX is language similar to VEX in Houdini, it'll be used to edit mesh attributes.

------ variables ------
float var = 5.0; -> local variable named var with value 5.0.
(type)$var = ...; -> mesh variable name var of type `type`, i.e float$var = 5.0; vector$P = {5.0, 1.0, 2.0};

all basis operators will be available such as: +, -, *, /
